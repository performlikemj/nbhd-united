# Default Templates

These are the default templates seeded for new users. Users can customize them via the Templates page. Always check `nbhd_journal_context` for the user's actual template sections -- don't assume defaults.

The agent maintains this document. Categories can evolve based on what's relevant to the user. Don't force empty categories -- only add sections when there's content for them.
